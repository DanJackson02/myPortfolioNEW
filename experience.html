        <ul id="skills">
            <li>I can drift a forklift. This is an advanced form or object avoidance and can easily be used to prevent injury in the event of possible collision.</li>
            <li>Great leadership. Do not let my age fool you, I have had a plethora of opportunities to develop my skills as a leader. Many of these have been as a stand in sergeant for the Army cadets, and some were opportunities presented o me by the HM Armed Forces</li>
            <li>Amazing problem solving. I naturally take an unconventional approach to many problems I may be faced with. Although it is not a standard way and can conflict with some colleagues (foreshadowing my next point), we, as a team, have always found a way to integrate our specialities and different techniques of problem solving</li>
            <li>Outstanding teamwork. Referenced in my previous skill, I have a tendancy to spend time with my team so we can learn how eatchother tick. A machine cannot function if none of the cogs want to rotate the same way. Although people have their uniqueness, we all have the same goal. </li>
